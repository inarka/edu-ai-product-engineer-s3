## OUTREACH ANGLE

### ✅ CO-OPETITION STRATEGY: "Comparing Notes on Building AI Sales Tools"

**Primary Hook:** Industry peer conversation between founders building in the same emerging space

**Recommended Approach:**

**1. Positioning: Peer-to-Peer, Not Prospect**
- Frame as founder-to-founder conversation, not a sales pitch
- Acknowledge you're both building in the AI sales automation space
- Express genuine curiosity about their approach and learnings

**2. Value Proposition: Mutual Knowledge Sharing**
- "I've been following onsa.ai's launch and would love to compare notes on what we're both learning about AI in sales"
- Share a specific insight or challenge from your side first (reciprocity principle)
- Suggest a short 20-minute conversation to exchange perspectives

**3. Specific Conversation Topics:**
- Market education strategies: How are you helping buyers understand AI sales automation value?
- Feature prioritization: What capabilities are customers actually using vs. requesting?
- Integration challenges: Which tools/systems are hardest to integrate with?
- Customer feedback patterns: What objections are you hearing most frequently?
- AI performance metrics: How are you measuring and improving AI output quality?

**4. Co-opetition Opportunities to Explore:**
- **Industry Standards:** Collaborate on best practices, ethical AI use in sales
- **Market Expansion:** Different ICP targeting (e.g., company size, industry verticals)
- **Non-Competing Features:** Potential integration or partnership on complementary capabilities
- **Joint Research:** Co-author industry reports on AI adoption in B2B sales
- **Event Collaboration:** Co-host webinars or workshops on AI sales transformation

**5. Competitive Intelligence Boundaries:**
- Be transparent about learning from each other while maintaining appropriate boundaries
- Don't ask about proprietary technology, pricing details, or specific customer names
- Focus on market-level insights, product philosophy, and category development

**Sample Opening Message:**

>
> Would you be open to a brief 20-minute conversation? I know you're busy scaling onsa.ai, so completely understand if the timing isn't right.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Best Case:** Ongoing peer relationship, industry insights exchange, potential collaboration opportunities
