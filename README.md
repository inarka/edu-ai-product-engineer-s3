# AI Product Engineer Course - Season 3

A hands-on course for building production-ready AI agents and workflows. Learn to make critical architectural decisions, implement multi-agent systems, and deploy AI products that deliver real business value.

## Course Overview

This course teaches you how to build AI products through 5 progressive workshops, each adding complexity while maintaining real-world applicability. By the end, you'll have built a complete production system from scratch.

### What You'll Build

**AutoReach** - An AI-powered B2B sales pipeline that:
- Researches prospects across multiple data sources
- Generates personalized outreach messages
- Self-corrects when encountering messy data
- Evaluates and optimizes its own performance
- Runs in production with monitoring and observability

### Learning Path

```
Workshop 1 (150 lines)     → Chained vs Agentic Workflows
Workshop 2 (450 lines)     → Building Reliable Agents
Workshop 3 (900 lines)     → Multi-agent orchestration system
Workshop 4 (1,200 lines)   → Evaluation framework & A/B testing
Workshop 5 (2,500+ lines)  → Multi-modal capabilities (voice, code, UI)
```
