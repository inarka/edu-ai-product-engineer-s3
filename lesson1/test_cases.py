# Expected behaviors:
# CHAINED WORKFLOW:
# - Clean URLs: ✅ Should work (5/5 success)
# - Messy URLs: ❌ Will likely fail on most (1-2/5 success)
#   - Missing protocol/www: EnrichLayer may reject
#   - Username variations: Won't find profile
#   - Incomplete data: Will crash on missing fields

# AGENTIC WORKFLOW:
# - Clean URLs: ✅ Should work (5/5 success)
# - Messy URLs: ✅ Agent can self-correct (4-5/5 success)
#   - Agent will try URL variations
#   - Can handle missing data gracefully
#   - Can reason about likely corrections

# For quick testing during workshop
# NOTE: EnrichLayer API is forgiving - missing protocol/www doesn't break it!
# To demonstrate chained workflow failure, we need actual DATA errors (typos, wrong username)
