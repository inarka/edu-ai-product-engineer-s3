# Dark Mode

## Problem
Users experience eye strain when using the app in low-light environments due to a bright UI with no dark theme option.

## Proposed solution
Add a Dark Mode theme that applies a dark color palette across the app, with a settings toggle (Light/Dark/System default). Ensure key screens, typography, icons, and contrast meet accessibility guidelines.

## User benefit
More comfortable nighttime use, reduced eye strain, improved accessibility, and higher user satisfaction/retention.

## Complexity
- Complexity: medium

## Priority recommendation
- Priority: high

## Acceptance criteria
- A user can select Light, Dark, or System default appearance in Settings.
- When set to Dark, all primary app screens render with dark backgrounds and readable text/icons without visual regressions.
- When set to System default, the app follows the device OS theme and updates on OS theme change (where supported).
- Color contrast in Dark Mode meets WCAG AA for text and essential UI elements.
- User preference persists across app restarts and updates.
