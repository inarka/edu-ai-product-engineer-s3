# Dark Mode

## Problem
Users experience eye strain and discomfort when using the app in low-light environments due to a bright UI.

## Proposed solution
Add an optional Dark Mode theme that applies a dark color palette across core screens. Include a setting to toggle Light/Dark and optionally follow the device/system theme.

## User benefit
Improves comfort for night use, reduces eye strain, and increases satisfaction and retention for users who prefer darker interfaces.

## Complexity
- Complexity: medium

## Priority recommendation
- Priority: high

## Acceptance criteria
- A Dark Mode theme is available and can be enabled/disabled from Settings.
- When enabled, core screens (navigation, backgrounds, text, dialogs) use dark colors with readable contrast.
- Theme choice persists across app restarts.
- No critical UI elements become unreadable or lose functionality in Dark Mode.
- (If supported) An option to match system theme correctly switches between light/dark based on OS settings.
